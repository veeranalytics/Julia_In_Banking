# Julia_In_Banking
Julia In Banking for Loan Prediction, Credit Card Fraud Transaction and Credit Risk Modeling.

## Loan Prediction Model
* Developed Artificial Neural Network model using Julia.
* Please open Loan_Prediction.jl to view Julia Code.
* The code was developed in Julia, then used RCall package to save the model in R format.
* Used Shiny to deploy the model.
* The application can be accessed at https://veeranalytics.shinyapps.io/Loan_Default_Prediction/

## Credit Card Fraud Transaction Model
* Developed Artificial Neural Network model using Julia.
* Please open Fraud_Transaction.jl to view Julia Code.
* The code was developed in Julia, then used RCall package to save the model in R format.
* Used Shiny to deploy the model.
* The application can be accessed at https://veeranalytics.shinyapps.io/Fraud_Transaction_Model/

## Credit Risk Model
* Developed Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models using Julia.
* Please open Credit_Risk.jl to view Julia Code.
* The code was developed in Julia, then used RCall package to save the model in R format.
* Used Shiny to deploy the model.
* The application can be accessed at https://veeranalytics.shinyapps.io/CreditRiskScorecard/

## Artificial Neural Network package for Julia-- vModels.jl
* Created a Julia package to develop Artificial Neural Network models.
* Includes functions for Data Preprocessing and Model Validation.
* The package can be accesses at https://veeranalytics.shinyapps.io/vModels.jl/
